## 0.0.1 - 2026-07-13

### Added

- AP2 checkout mandate support: `checkout.complete` accepts an `ap2.checkout_mandate` (validated against the spec's SD-JWT pattern), tagged `Ap2CheckoutMandateVerifierInterface` services verify it against the current checkout before completion (failures map to a 422 with a stable AP2 error code and violations), and checkout responses are signed with an ES256 detached JWS embedded as `ap2.merchant_authorization` when AP2 is enabled
- when AP2 is active for a request (the `dev.ucp.shopping.ap2_mandate` capability was negotiated or the completion payload carries an `ap2` member), `checkout.complete` requests without an `ap2.checkout_mandate` are rejected with the stable `mandate_required` error code, and every checkout response of a negotiated session carries `ap2.merchant_authorization`, as the AP2 mandates specification requires
- payment instruments submitted via `checkout.complete` now run through the same payment mandate verifiers and `PaymentMandateVerificationEvent` as `checkout.update`
- signing-key commands (`ucp:signing-keys:generate` / `list` / `show-public`) now accept an optional `--tenant` identifier and route to the tenant-aware repository when one is provided; without it they behave exactly as before (global scope) ([#73](https://github.com/agentic-commerce-alliance/ucp-php-sdk/pull/73))
- new `ucp:signing-keys:retire` and `ucp:signing-keys:delete` commands complete the key lifecycle (both tenant-aware) ([#73](https://github.com/agentic-commerce-alliance/ucp-php-sdk/pull/73))
- the signing-key commands are no longer `final`/`@internal` and expose a `resolveTenantIdentifier()` extension point, so integrators (e.g. the Shopware plugin) can map a domain-specific option to the tenant instead of shipping their own commands ([#73](https://github.com/agentic-commerce-alliance/ucp-php-sdk/pull/73))
- `resolveTenantIdentifier()` now receives the command's `OutputInterface`, so an override can prompt interactively or print guidance; an override may throw to abort the command (the exception surfaces as a non-zero exit) ([#76](https://github.com/agentic-commerce-alliance/ucp-php-sdk/pull/76))
- enforce UCP request-time negotiation so requests are validated against the negotiated protocol version and capabilities ([#65](https://github.com/agentic-commerce-alliance/ucp-php-sdk/pull/65))
- runtime capability enablement, allowing capabilities to be toggled on at runtime rather than only at build time ([#50](https://github.com/agentic-commerce-alliance/ucp-php-sdk/pull/50))
- improved remote profile validation for discovered/remote UCP profiles ([#47](https://github.com/agentic-commerce-alliance/ucp-php-sdk/pull/47))
- additional validation schemas covering previously unschema'd payloads ([#42](https://github.com/agentic-commerce-alliance/ucp-php-sdk/pull/42))
- improved JSON parsing error handling with clearer failure reporting ([#45](https://github.com/agentic-commerce-alliance/ucp-php-sdk/pull/45))
- storage smoke tests to guard the default storage adapters ([#38](https://github.com/agentic-commerce-alliance/ucp-php-sdk/pull/38))

### Changed

- **breaking:** `CheckoutCapabilityInterface::completeCheckout()` and `CheckoutAdapterInterface::completeCheckout()` now receive a `CheckoutCompleteRequest` (id, payment selection, AP2 data) instead of a string id, plus an optional `?Checkout $verifiedCheckout` snapshot — the checkout state the AP2 mandate verifiers approved; implementations must update their signatures and must not complete a checkout whose terms diverged from a provided snapshot (throw `Ap2Exception` with `mandate_scope_mismatch`), closing the verification-to-completion race
- the AP2 merchant-authorization signer now picks its ES256 key deterministically when several are active (newest `createdAt` first, `kid` as tiebreaker) instead of relying on repository ordering
- lowered the PHP requirement from `^8.2` to `^8.1`; `readonly class` declarations were replaced with individually `readonly`-annotated promoted properties across core, symfony-bundle, and examples ([#13](https://github.com/agentic-commerce-alliance/ucp-php-sdk/pull/13))
- removed Symfony dependencies from the framework-free core package ([#53](https://github.com/agentic-commerce-alliance/ucp-php-sdk/pull/53))
- adopted `phpseclib` for signing operations
- marked internal-only classes as `@internal` to clarify the public API surface ([#52](https://github.com/agentic-commerce-alliance/ucp-php-sdk/pull/52))
- refactored the UCP response envelope and money serialization to be spec-derived ([#67](https://github.com/agentic-commerce-alliance/ucp-php-sdk/pull/67))
- improved integrator onboarding documentation and closed review gaps ([#72](https://github.com/agentic-commerce-alliance/ucp-php-sdk/pull/72))

### Fixed

- include the negotiated UCP metadata in REST response envelopes ([#68](https://github.com/agentic-commerce-alliance/ucp-php-sdk/pull/68))
- make the catalog-product REST binding protocol-conformant and emit the catalog-product capability ([#69](https://github.com/agentic-commerce-alliance/ucp-php-sdk/pull/69))
- require the UCP agent header on incoming requests ([#66](https://github.com/agentic-commerce-alliance/ucp-php-sdk/pull/66))
- fail on duplicate registry entries instead of silently overwriting ([#51](https://github.com/agentic-commerce-alliance/ucp-php-sdk/pull/51))
- fix the OAuth metadata route ([#41](https://github.com/agentic-commerce-alliance/ucp-php-sdk/pull/41))
- fix idempotency claim handling, including concurrent idempotency safety ([#39](https://github.com/agentic-commerce-alliance/ucp-php-sdk/pull/39))
- fix digest verification result reporting ([#49](https://github.com/agentic-commerce-alliance/ucp-php-sdk/pull/49))
- fix A2A update-id validation ([#70](https://github.com/agentic-commerce-alliance/ucp-php-sdk/pull/70))
- fix discovery signing keys ([#35](https://github.com/agentic-commerce-alliance/ucp-php-sdk/pull/35))
- limit database introspection to SDK-owned tables only ([#36](https://github.com/agentic-commerce-alliance/ucp-php-sdk/pull/36))
- fix outbound webhook publishing ([#40](https://github.com/agentic-commerce-alliance/ucp-php-sdk/pull/40))
- expose MCP endpoints as metadata-only ([#43](https://github.com/agentic-commerce-alliance/ucp-php-sdk/pull/43))
- match the full request origin during origin validation ([#44](https://github.com/agentic-commerce-alliance/ucp-php-sdk/pull/44))

### Security

- fail closed when encrypted-storage decryption fails, rather than returning plaintext or empty data ([#48](https://github.com/agentic-commerce-alliance/ucp-php-sdk/pull/48))
- mitigate SSRF in outbound/remote profile fetching ([#37](https://github.com/agentic-commerce-alliance/ucp-php-sdk/pull/37))
